# Bookly

**Bookly** is an application developed as part of the **Master's course "Tools and Methods of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering"** at the **University of Belgrade, Faculty of Organizational Sciences**. Inspired by the intuitive and personalized user experience of Spotify, Bookly shifts its focus to the realm of books, offering platform for book discovery, management, and reading enhancement.

## Let me explain why you might need Bookly

Picture this: you're staring at your bookshelf (or e-reader) wondering what to read next. Do you:

1. Re-read that book you kinda remember finishing but arenâ€™t sure? ðŸ“–ðŸ¤”
2. Scroll endlessly through online reviews, only to end up more confused? ðŸ“±ðŸ™ƒ
3. Give up and binge-watch South Park instead? ðŸ“ºðŸ˜…

In my case I would typicaly start with option 2 followed by thinking about option 1 just to proceed with option 3. If you are at least a little bit like me, thatâ€™s where Bookly comes in to save the day (and your reading list).

Bookly serves up personalized book recommendations tailored to your taste. It is literally your sidekick that is always there to help you make a decision, discover and dive into next reading adventure.

Bookly is like that one super-organized and reliable friend with an incredible memory. It keeps track of every book you say you want to read and makes sure you never forget. And trust me, it wonâ€™t let you off the hook when it comes to your reading sessionsâ€”**seriously, donâ€™t skip your reading sessions!** And yeah, he also keeps track of what youâ€™ve read (so you donâ€™t accidentally re-read that book again).

So why wouldnâ€™t you need friend like Bookly?
